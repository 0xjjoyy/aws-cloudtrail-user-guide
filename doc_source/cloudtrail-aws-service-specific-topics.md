# CloudTrail Integration Topics by AWS Service<a name="cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics"></a>

You can use other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs\. For more information, see the following topics\.


****  

| AWS Service | Topic | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Amazon Athena | [Querying AWS CloudTrail Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html) | Using Athena with CloudTrail logs is a powerful way to enhance your analysis of AWS service activity\. For example, you can use queries to identify trends and further isolate activity by attribute, such as source IP address or user\.   Running queries in Amazon Athena incurs additional costs\. For more information, see [Amazon Athena Pricing\.](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/) | 
| Amazon CloudWatch Logs | [Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs](monitor-cloudtrail-log-files-with-cloudwatch-logs.md) | You can configure CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to monitory your trail logs and be notified when specific activity occurs\. For example, you can define CloudWatch Logs metric filters that will trigger CloudWatch alarms and send notifications to you when those alarms are triggered\.   Standard pricing for Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudWatch Logs applies\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.   | 

You can learn more about how the events for individual AWS services are recorded in CloudTrail logs, including example events for that service in log files\. For more information about how specific AWS services integrate with CloudTrail, see the specific service topics about integration in the individual guide for that service\.
